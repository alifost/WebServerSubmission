## Synopsis

This project was an online coding challenge for a software engineering position within bRealTime. We had to create a simple web server that could accept http get requests and produce plain text. I also had to write an algorithm to solve a small char puzzle.

## Setup

I used an Apache server which is embedded in Apple's OSX (as it runs atop UNIX) and PHP for my application layer. To create the local server I simply enabled Apache and PHP on my machine. This was my first experience programming in PHP. 

Additionally, I enabled port forwarding from my router to my personal IP address to route all requests to my local server. This repo is a copy of all of the code used for this project.
